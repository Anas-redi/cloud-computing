from and welcome to Microsoft. Learn for

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.790
educators, virtual educator prep session for

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.680
Azure Fundamentals or a Z 900.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.060
So first I'll start off by introducing myself

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.420
As mentioned, my name is Molly Murray. I'm an Azure

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.820
or Microsoft technical trainers. You could say an

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.470
my experience prior to Microsoft. I spent most of my

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.810
career as in software development mixed with a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.150
a little bit of consulting as well. And then I dived into my

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.920
cloud journey and ever since it has been a wonderful

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440
experience. Being a trainer here with Microsoft.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.550
As some of my highlights you see listed

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.180
there, I am on what we call our fundamentals team where we

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.500
focus on fundamental Microsoft courses and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.900
we train and teach learners globally. So I'm

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.120
very excited to be able to share my knowledge with you as you approach

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.250
teaching this particular course an any that come

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.870
later on in the future.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.620
Alright, so first and foremost we kind of want

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.760
to dive into talking about the expectations

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.770
for this particular session an when we think

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.820
about the expectations and feel free to jot

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.470
down some of your expectations that you have today

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.560
for the session an I would love to address what we're covering

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.660
as well as any comments or concerns

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.660
that you may have, but this is a great opportunity within your

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.710
classes to learn more about your students as well. So being able to understand what

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.400
excites them about.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.720
The Azure fundamentals, if they have prior

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.980
cloud experience different things like that and the very most important thing

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.990
to let them know is that this is an

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.300
introduction into the cloud and so this is their first stop

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.570
into their cloud journey in order to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.950
o build that confidence in the fundamental building blocks as they start

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.250
to dive into more maybe complex parts of

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.890
the cloud. Or they want to increase their knowledge for potential

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.330
job opportunities. And so definitely this is a great place

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.940
to be as your students start to learn about the cloud and as they want

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.890
to expand their knowledge.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.320
In it.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.680
So the other kind of note, I want to add on here

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.770
is that this session, this virtual educator

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.090
prep session is focusing solely on

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.680
the approach to how you are going to teach the Azure

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.980
fundamentals to your students, and so we're not actually going

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.600
to walk through all the demonstrations and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.290
basically teach the Azure content

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.890
itself where solely focusing on the approach in the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.060
best practices and tips and tricks in order to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.210
teach this course successfully to your students.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.620
So a short kind of agenda here it may look

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.050
k like a lot of bullet points there, but it's going to go really smoothly

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.140
today. And so some of the important things that will talk

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.320
about throughout today is going to be resources where you can

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.740
find this information that's being covered today as

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.430
well as you further information you'll need as you

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480
prepare to teach the content and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.820
really feel confident about it.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.700
Then we'll dive into a little bit of Accessibility

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.710
Understanding what that means and how you can integrate those best practices

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.920
into your classrooms. Then we'll switch

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.080
gears and start to talk about the overall

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.190
approach. The course flow in the module best

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.770
practices, so really will breakdown each module and look at

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.970
what is important out of this module. How do I want to

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.080
approach teaching this information to my students and what they

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.670
would want to focus on when they're preparing to take the exam?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.780
And then we'll kind of wrap up with what the

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.170
best strategies are around demonstration. So when your demo ING to your

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.710
students and giving them opportunities to take those demos

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.520
and perform them as labs and what those strategies may look

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.990
like, and then at the end will cover a little bit of

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.640
supplemental materials. Things that I feel that will be very

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.680
beneficial for you as you begin to either prepare to teach

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.720
the course, or for those that may have not taken the exam

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.910
yet. You also can benefit from those materials as well.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.960
So first let's look at resources.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.620
So when I talk about these resources here today

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.000
on this kind of particular slide, you're

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.040
going to really want to focus on this, is what

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.120
you can benefit from. And so when you get here

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.130
and you say OK, I want to Start learning. I really, maybe I don't

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.280
have the certification myself as an

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.780
n instructor, the first thing that you'll want to look at is the

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.790
Microsoft Learning Path. This is free

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.870
website that's accessible to everyone

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.110
globally, and they are able to go out and actually walk through

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.470
the content that is on the exam.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.010
And so it is a self paced learning path. You can track your

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.560
where you're at in the path there are

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.280
e knowledge check questions at the end of each section. It's a

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.440
very interactive kind of learning option that you

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.700
can leverage and benefit from and personally in

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.940
my training courses when I teach this content that

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.280
t is the place that we point all of our learners too is the Microsoft

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.540
t learning path.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.650
Another option that you have is to

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.910
attend Microsoft Virtual Training Day if you

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.030
u go to events.microsoft.com that is going to

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.210
be alive, training that you

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.330
can broadcast to see and walk through the content as well

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.410
There is an instructor that is teaching it and it's going to

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.610
of course be more interactive as you're able to ask

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.830
questions and there are moderators there. Live answering your

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.630
questions as that event is taking place.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.250
Also, you can benefit from practice

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.720
exams and then also vouchers that you have

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.220
available to take the certification. So for those process excuse

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.570
me, practice exams you have free or discounted

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.160
price is available to you as an educator and then as well

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.370
for the certification also. So I do highly

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.670
encourage that you prepare and ramp up if you've not taken the exam

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.490
already as you prepare to you, teach your students about it.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.500
Additionally, there is an

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.630
overview of the materials that you either have

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:00.010
already gained access to or that you can

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.170
currently gain access to as well. And if you visit that

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.450
link there AKA dot Ms slash LDC you will

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.510
see all of this information there and so

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.660
o some of those things are listed here, such as

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.810
assessment guides, course data sheets so

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.150
o outlines and course timings of how you may want to break up teaching

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:21.630
particular content.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.740
There is also the educator teaching guide that's going

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.430
to be your high level overview of all the things that you're kind of wanting to

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.620
know around the materials. Planning any

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.970
technology requirements, and keep in mind I will cover some of these

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.980
topics at a high level today, however, your

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.290
educator teaching God is going to have a lot of it

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.850
written down for you to be able to go back and access as well.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.700
And then there's also the additional lab instructions

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.980
for helping walkthrough demos with your students

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.450
the PowerPoint slides and things as well and

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.540
d then also the Trainer Handbook, which is

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:03.090
going to give you that found no knowledge of what you're teaching

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.710
and kind of really more away that you can look at it from a

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.020
textbook textbook standpoint per say.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.240
Also, the information that is

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.320
being shared today through this presentation if

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.400
f you want to go back and revisit this recording, it will

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.650
also be at that link as well, AKA dot

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.460
Ms Slash L DC.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.930
And we will cover the supplemental materials

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.680
links as well, so we'll be able to come back and see those also.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.070
Now looking at the

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.170
Azure credit, so a lot of our questions come from

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.790
kind of understanding how you approach teaching

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.070
and having enough credits to walk through these

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.100
demonstrations and labs with your students and so kind

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.750
of a couple highlights here that you'll want to note is that

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.960
for students they get $100 credit

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.640
when they create the Azure for students account that is going to be

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.450
typically for your students over the age of 18, and that can be renewable as well.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.700
As an educator, you would get a $200

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.880
credit when you create the free Azure account and then there are

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.430
a couple of other options here around Azure

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.440
Lab Services and dev Tools for teaching

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.770
This is going to be sometimes a preconfigured environment that you

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.120
can leverage and benefit from, but most of these other

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.280
kind of scenarios you would want to reach out to your Microsoft

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.500
contact. So in your case your it PM

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.660
or representative that is able to share with you

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.260
what options your institution has when it comes to.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.460
The different credit options.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.820
Additionally, based on

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.010
teachings and in other kind of feedback and things that

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.220
we get, there is not a lot of credits that are

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.250
required for the fundamental courses and that is

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.030
based on best practices of you create your

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.100
r resources and then you shut them down or you remove them when you no

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.650
longer need them as we know if you keep your resources

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.320
up and running, they're just going to keep eating up at your credits and

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.550
so that is something that you want to keep in mind once you

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.000
u are finished, you remove them or shut them down so that you're not

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.880
continually paying for something that you're not using.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.050
Lastly, here with the credits

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.280
the number one question that we get is, well, what if my students

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.410
or I as an instructor run out of

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.740
credits? We encourage you to reach out

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.220
again to your Microsoft contact or it PM whoever your

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.650
Microsoft Representative may be in order to find

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.330
out what the options are for your institution.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.030
So now let's switch gears and talk a little bit about Accessibility

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.230
and some of you may be familiar with this topic

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.330
as it is important in classes or

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.630
classroom settings to think about this particular

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.320
approach. When you're teaching an really. When we think about

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.380
Accessibility, we're engaging with learners that have diverse

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.520
learning needs. An as instructors, we must make

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.010
sure that our learning environment is always inclusive

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.440
and always allows our learners to feel confident and

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.320
d so with that, there are multiple ways to.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.590
Kind of make your again environment

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.730
your presentations. How you approach teaching things to

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.170
be as inclusive as possible.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.320
So one of the first things you'll see is making your PowerPoint

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.650
presentation accessible, so making sure that your

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.170
students have possible have the Accessibility for the

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.570
PowerPoint for the slides, or for whichever information that they are

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.740
needing. Additionally, looking at accommodating the

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.860
different needs that students may have

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.620
so looking at hearing mobility, vision, neurodiversity

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.880
these are all things that some of us

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.590
may not think about on a regular basis.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.120
Especially if it's not something that you're

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.190
experiencing or have experienced, and so with that being

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.320
said, we must think top of mind that

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.500
every individual is unique in different ways and we want to

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.470
make sure that everyone feels confident.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.530
So for example, myself when

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:20.760
I was teaching and in the role that I'm in

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.310
I traveled every week to different Microsoft Office

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.690
e isn't taught thousands of learners globally, I

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.730
have encountered on multiple occasions learners that approach

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:34.350
me and say I have a hearing impairment. What do you

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.860
suggest to make sure that I'm able to follow along with your

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.960
training or presentation today? And I would always encourage them to sit in the

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.170
front of the room to make sure

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.110
that I am projecting. Clearly that I'm able to.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.480
Speak and make sure that I'm articulate with how I'm

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.700
explaining things, and I would ask them throughout

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.060
if everything is good. If I need to change anything to

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.120
meet their needs, so with that I always try to make

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.210
everyone feel as inclusive as possible.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.120
There are also the several

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.260
additional kind of tips and tricks in your educator teaching guide

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.310
that I mentioned, and so in there there's a lot of materials in

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.510
different links and things that you can visit to

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.330
understand how you can help adapt to the environment as well.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.010
So now let's look at the overall approach.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.380
And when I say the overall approach this

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.570
s is how I teach the course. This is things

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.840
that I want to establish at the beginning, and so in your

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.960
case, when you're thinking about teaching your students the overall

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.580
l approach is that very first top of mine couple

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.740
e of sentences that you tell them when they are in

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.080
know in your classroom and what I mean by that

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.240
r example, this is a high level

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.310
overview of Microsoft Azure. This is the

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.500
fundamental course, so we won't go too technical too

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.420
deep into topics.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.800
We're going to keep it high level. We're going to go about a

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.070
mile wide inch deep into each topic that we're covering and

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.230
d I make sure that the students and the learners in my

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.900
class understand that just because in my particular

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.170
case I may have some that are a little bit more advanced, or

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.510
they have a little bit more knowledge, and so they may want to dive deeper in

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.730
certain areas, but I have to reel him back in to let them know that this

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:33.110
is a

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.560
fundamental class and we want to make sure that everyone is getting the same information and that they feel confident.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.060
In the topics as they prepare for the exam.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.110
So when we look at this first kind

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.430
of area here, we look up objective domains and there

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.660
are six different modules that tie directly

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.730
to the certification exam and

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.190
d as you start to go down the different modules, you're diving more

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.550
into Azure concepts and topics. So when

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.790
we first look at module one, that's what I like to say

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.050
The first layer, the first building block that's

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.410
s it. That is cloud concepts that is looking at you

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.610
t is the cloud and.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.810
What are some of the key terms and things of that sort?

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.560
But as you go down into module 234

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.660
so on and so forth, that is going to target

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.860
directly more Azure, you're looking at Azure

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.560
Services, the different solutions and tools, and ways that

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.880
you can integrate services in Azure as well

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.050
So with that we will actually spend some time walking

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.190
through the best practices of each module, but

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.530
the very important thing when we look at the overall approach is

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.800
that you explain to your students that this is a fundamental course

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.820
This is going to introduce them to the cloud.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.210
And especially to Azure and how they can

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.710
leverage and benefit using some of the services as they learn

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.820
more about them.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.550
As mentioned.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.500
All six of the modules map directly to

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.720
a certification exam and is listed here, you'll see

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.040
that there are weight percentage is tide each of

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.440
f those objective domains, and with that being

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.030
said, you'll notice some of those weights or a little different

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.320
than others, meaning that you might see or your

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.270
r students might see more questions in those areas with the

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.450
higher percentages on their exam and

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.810
d with that you want to make sure that you have a general understanding

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:31.410
across all of the different.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.530
Areas just because those percentages are

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.230
pretty close to one another for those that might be

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.520
familiar, we had a different version of the examine

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.830
different content, slightly modified content prior

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.100
to, and it was in a four module format. We've now

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.320
migrated to ES6 module format an it is

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.800
very smooth, very easy to follow

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.050
and we kind of spread out some of

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:02.070
those weights so that it's easy to kind of study each area and feel confident across those different topics.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.690
Additionally, as you explain to your

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.870
students about the certification, again, you want them

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.100
to feel confident in each area, simply because those percentages

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.160
are pretty close to one another, even though

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.690
you might see more questions in certain areas, it's still important to

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.360
have a high level understanding across the different areas.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.640
And this time when I'm in my

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.760
courses, I will walk through a couple

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.000
of questions about the preparation of the exam

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.400
such as you only need 700 points out of a

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.240
000 to pass their all multiple choice questions, so there are

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.340
no labs in the exam. That's something that you really

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.760
want to make sure your students understand that even though in your course they may

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.910
have opportunities for demonstrations in labs, they won't

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.580
actually have to do those in their exam.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.490
Adding on to the overall approach, the next thing

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.930
is setting expectations. So remember when we first started

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.130
this session, I talked about the expectations for

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.400
this session of what we would be covering today and it's going to be

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.430
very important again that you let your students and

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.700
set their overall expectations for the class that they have registered for.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.650
So the very first question is who is the audience

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.790
I get that question all the time simply

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.810
because everyone wants to know if I want to learn about the cloud do

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.850
o I have to be super technical? Do I have to have that type

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.360
of background? And the answer is no this certification

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.420
n exam is designed for candidates looking to

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.590
demonstrate that foundational knowledge of the cloud and

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.910
d so with that anyone can sign up to take

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.660
this particular type. Of course, learn about this type of

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:50.850
content, whether you're

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.910
Technical whether your business more business

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.960
oriented across any type of

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.090
roll that you're in, we say that this is the best

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.280
place to be as you start your cloud journey because

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.240
it is the fundamentals.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.580
What are the prerequisites as mentioned

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.630
d, because it's a fundamental course, there are no prerequisites this

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.070
s is your first stop into your cloud journey, so letting

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.690
your students know that this is the best place to be as they start

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.810
to grow and want to expand their knowledge of the cloud.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.410
Hands on labs. So as I mentioned

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.870
d, we'll talk about this a little bit more as we go through

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.150
this session today. But we talk about hands on labs. That's going to

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.500
give your students an opportunity to really get their

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.690
hands dirty in Azure. I am

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.180
personally a visual learner, and so for

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.780
me, Labs is a great opportunity to kind of connect the dots

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.910
between lecture and actual demonstration

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.140
Being able to see how the service works and how

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.880
it's integrated with other.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.270
And so with that, hands-on labs is a great

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.840
way to reinforce what your students are learning.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.940
And then Lastly, the goal is Azure certification.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.200
For all of your students and for yourself, I always encourage

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.620
everyone to take the certification exam I do

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.130
o have learners that will sign up for trainings and you

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.030
ask who is everyone going to take the exam and they may say, yeah, I don't know

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.420
e always encourage them to. Just because it's a

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.560
great skill set to have, especially for your students as they

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.890
are wanting to expand and maybe even look for

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.160
potential job opportunities or wanting to

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.590
dive into certain areas in technology.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.740
The cloud is forever growing and

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.210
expanding. Its very innovative and so this is a great place

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.730
to be kind of gaining those skills and the knowledge

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:44.970
around cloud.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.470
Now it looks like a little bit about

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.580
customizing content to fit your environment, So what

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.880
that simply means is that we will get

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.430
questions around. Well. How can I break up the content? How can

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.440
I approach teaching it in a timely fashion and

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.550
integrating labs and doing different things and

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.590
d so this question can be a little bit

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.950
more generalized, just depending on the structure of

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.230
your University or college and that

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.380
t means that whether you're on a semester or year based

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.670
how you're breaking up your course is going to be a determining factor.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.000
Here.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.880
And as I mentioned, you have

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.050
your learning download center and all of the different you

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.200
ecator guides and preps that will also have

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.030
this information for you to reference as well. And so the

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.220
Azure fundamental provides approximately 16 hours

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.290
of content. However, it can be used in different

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.320
ways. It can be taught in different formats so it

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.630
could be that it's introduced inside of an

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.990
existing course that's already taught it also

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.390
o can be alongside of course, where.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.530
The learning objectives are broadly aligned

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.770
so maybe there is another course that is cloud related that

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.970
you want to integrate these particular topics or

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.950
concepts into. You can do that as well.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.350
Or of course, you have the option as a standalone

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.420
course. You want to have the Azure fundamentals as a course

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.710
that can be integrated into your

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.020
institution as well. However, as I

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.310
mentioned, the time required is going to vary based

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.560
on which approach you select as well as the labs and how

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.710
you integrate that with your students. So you have a lot of

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.990
options of how to customize the

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.720
content into your environment.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.520
So now let's look at technical requirements.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.290
So for technical requirements, we won't

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.500
spend much time on this slide just because, again

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.250
it is included in your learning downloads that are all of

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.670
your teaching guides and things that you're provided with, but I'm going to

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.030
highlight a couple of important things here.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.220
So when it comes to it being an educator

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.930
of course you have typical things that are required, such as

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.340
your PC or laptop. How you're going to display your slides

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.440
in the information to your students. However, the important thing to

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.730
have here is your Azure subscription and as we

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.020
e know, in order to create any of the services within

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.350
Azure, you must have a subscription that is

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.570
live and has credits that are readily available to

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.460
use, and so it's going to be really important that you have the subscription set up.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.490
Prior to teaching your course, just so that you're

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.770
prepared when it comes to doing those demonstrations

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:46.940
and things for your students.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.060
Additionally, for the students, it's going to be the

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.750
same having access to

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.560
the presentation. Having a PC laptop, all of that fun stuff

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.670
again. Also, having an Azure subscription is going to be the

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.630
most appropriate thing here that's recommended for their lab

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.790
practice, so definitely making sure if possible

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.520
that you send out instructions or

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.270
information to your students, maybe a couple weeks or so before the class so that

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:19.930
they already have their subscription ready to go.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.000
And when you start your class, they can just hit the ground

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.260
running and you won't have to do a lot of troubleshooting when

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.330
it comes to their subscription setup.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.720
So now let's look at course flow.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.280
So the course flow is going to

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.310
be very important to think about, because this is

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.530
focusing on making sure that your students can

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.680
follow along with your sessions. So when

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.440
you approach teaching, however, you've chosen maybe the standalone

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.480
course, or maybe you've chosen to integrate some of these

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.780
topics into a current course you have, however

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.220
you choose to customize your content for your students, it is still

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.910
going to be very important that they are able to follow

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:12.410
along and.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.900
Take heed to the different topics and things

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.420
being covered because of course they will need to be feeling

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.580
confident as they prepare to take the exam.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.450
So making sure that you're slide

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.480
slide deck and all of that is created for optimal

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.550
flow. It's easy to follow along I

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.590
I personally feel that the Azure content and how it

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:38.130
is presented now with the six module format is phenomenal

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.280
It introduces topics at the perfect time

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.450
Typically we may have students that say, ask A

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.670
question. What is this? An will be getting ready to introduce that

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.010
topic just right on the next slide and so therefore we

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.320
have really taken a lot of time.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.780
To make sure that our deck that we're presenting

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.310
or providing for you is easy to follow along so

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.510
that you don't have to go in and make a lot

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.010
of changes, modifications and things of that sort.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.210
Now the important thing that you will want to

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.790
know is that because you're teaching this to your

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.780
students, it's going to be taught in multiple sessions, and that's

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.060
inevitable. Just because you're going to be teaching over a semester over

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.300
a year. However, it's broken up for you and

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.530
d with that it's going to be important that you build on top

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.540
of the topics that you're covering. So if we're talking

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.640
about module one, even though you're breaking up

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.660
that content, you want to make sure that your students are still

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.640
able to follow along.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.080
And remember the topics that are being covered overtime.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.420
The important thing that is

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.610
going to play a role in making sure that your students

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.370
remember is going to be review questions.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.920
These are already things that I'm sure many of you instructors

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.970
already do, but homework assignments

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.110
quizzes test all of that great stuff

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.600
aving reviews to make sure that your students are able to

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.420
remember the content that is being covered.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:09.490
Now a couple of more things here that

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.930
are course completely optional depending on the structure of

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.880
your class, and I know that we are in unique Times Now

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.000
A lot of virtual sessions and a lot of virtual

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.520
universities and things are taking place now, but

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.730
developing slide deck notes Whiteboarding where appropriate

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.430
There's lots and lots, of course benefits around those things just

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.910
because as you start to teach some of the topics with the

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.960
Azure fundamentals, you may find that.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.430
Jotting down some examples or jotting down

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.490
some important notes is going to be very helpful so that

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.510
you don't try to remember every single

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.260
intricate detail about something you can just have a couple of

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.490
side notes there and say, here's an example around

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.900
this service. Here is something that maybe everyone can relate to.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.670
And I'll talk about some of those examples as we continue

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:58.890
on today.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.160
So now that we talked about kind

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.250
of the overall approach setting expectations

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.790
s and all of the things that you want to do to lay the

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.980
beginning, introduction to what this course is

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:21.140
really about now want to focus on module

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.470
best practices. So how you're going to approach

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.280
teaching each module to your students?

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.920
So the first module is going to be

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.280
cloud concepts and I like to say that this is

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.700
very important because it's building the foundation

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.150
of well. What is the cloud? And so if you have students that have

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.410
just never really known about the cloud, maybe they've done very

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.850
minor research or they really just don't have much

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.080
knowledge. This is going to be a very important module

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.310
that they understand.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.420
So it's building the foundation around key

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.500
terms terms that they'll see throughout the cloud

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.690
and especially if they continue on their cloud journey after

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.800
the fundamentals. Also, cloud services and

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.130
models. So when we talk about cloud models public

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.270
c cloud, private cloud, hybrid, cloud, what those

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.980
mean cloud services infrastructure as a service

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.250
platform, software as a service all of those

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.290
e terminologies, services and models are going to be very

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.150
important that your students understand.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.510
Because they will see them all throughout

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.800
any cloud course that they take as they start

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.340
to use the cloud. All of those things are going to be very

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.560
very relevant as they go through out and learn more about

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:35.670
the cloud.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.980
There are also

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.600
great places to introduce storytelling case studies

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.090
and I like to say focusing on real

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.520
institution examples can also be beneficial because

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.880
it helps your students bridge the gap

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.330
between. OK, I'm learning about the cloud, but how is this really used in

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.710
my day to day life? Maybe my institution uses cloud

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.730
services. Maybe there's a Department that is

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.910
leveraging some of these tools and features and

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:08.000
different things so thinking about.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.830
How you can integrate real world examples or

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.650
institution examples into your teaching as well?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:19.470
I like to use fun examples, so for example

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.870
if we look at the cloud models, when I

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.270
introduced that topic to my learners, I'll introduce

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.390
the public cloud as a taxi

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:32.480
cab and say hey, I want to hop into this

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.810
taxi and use this service. So I'm going to pay for this service as

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.510
I use it. I raised my hand. I'm in New York, I said hey, I need a taxi

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.590
Someone else raises their hand and says hey, I'm headed in the same direction

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.170
Let's hop in this taxi cab together we can share

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.470
this resource.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.070
And head to our destination.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.870
Now once we reach our destination, we

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.880
both pay our money. We hop out and we're no longer

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.270
paying for that resource, so therefore the public

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.530
cloud allows me to share resources with other users and

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.720
d I'm paying for that resource as I'm using it once

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.080
I no longer need it. I don't have to pay for it anymore.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.660
So that is how I give examples around the public cloud

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.130
maybe with the private cloud I say.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.250
A lot of private limo. I have my own private limo

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.310
or car service. I tell the limousine where

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.070
to go. I have this black tinted car

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.240
No one can see me. I use that as an example

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.470
of the private cloud because as an organization they

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.880
have complete control over the security. They have complete control

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.310
over how that data center is managed so they get

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:40.650
to control who, what, when, where, how

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.690
all of those things and they don't have to

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:43.820
share that resource with anyone.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.790
So that's just a couple of examples I try to like. I said make it a

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.830
little more interactive for my learners and kind

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.880
of again paint the bigger picture as to hey

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.890
I use a taxi. I use a limousine. It makes sense.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.460
Now for Module 2 this is going

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.580
to be core Azure services. So when we look at

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.590
module two I like to say this is the meat of

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.790
the course. This is where a lot of the content kind of

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.920
sits, even though we spread out a lot of the topics these

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.700
are going to be very important topics for your students to

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.100
remember, just because it's really again now

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.110
that you've introduced the foundation of what the

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.230
cloud is an introducing Azure Now we're

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.720
e going to look at how am I actually going to create.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.740
Resources in Azure. How does Azure

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.090
actually work together to create different services

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.160
and integrate with other types of goals

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.360
and things that I need to maybe run a business?

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.860
So with that module two will definitely

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.560
be broken up into multiple sessions just because it is a lot of

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.830
content and again utilizing case studies utilizing

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.880
storytelling, making real world examples or

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.380
institution examples apart of your sessions.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.680
When we talk about Module 2.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.410
A couple of the important things you'll see here that are

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.640
bullet pointed architectural components.

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:13.890
That's going to be.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.130
Regions availability

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:21.600
zones resource groups that is introducing how something

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.810
is created in Azure, and so when we talk about

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.730
a region are region in Azure, is comprised of one or

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.010
multiple data centers. So how that works is

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.030
OK. I want to create let's say a virtual machine. When I create that

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.080
virtual machine, I must select a region in which that virtual

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.680
machine is going to be deployed into what's inside of the

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.840
regions data centers. That is where my virtual machine

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.800
is. It's inside of a data center.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.660
That is inside of a region and so knowing

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.150
g and understanding those architectural components is going to be very important

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:53.270
for your students.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.160
Now when we look at some of the other

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.230
services here, such as databases, compute

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:04.090
storage, all of those are going to be great opportunities to do

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.530
demonstrations. There's really a demo option for every one of

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.310
those areas that you can explore.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.500
When we talk about compute, services were looking

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.230
at virtual machines containers, storage you'll

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.450
breakdown some of the different areas around storage you can

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.090
n do demonstration around that, and then of course networking as

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.270
well. But what I do want to note is that you do not have to

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.930
do every demo and remember that's because there

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.130
are no demos or labs or anything in the

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.330
actual exam. This is just an opportunity for

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.990
your students to get their hands on experience that they're looking for.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.580
Being able to create these different services.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.220
Now when we look at Module 3, this is going to

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.590
be core solutions an management

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.340
tools. So I like to really look at Module 3 as.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.180
What is the best solution for given scenarios

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.200
So if I have this business that's needing

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.660
to create some type of service that reads in you

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.840
device information, things of that

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.040
sort, what would be the best solution for this and I

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.190
I would select one of these core solutions? Those are maybe the types

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.490
of questions that you could encounter.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.020
So with that you'll see things around

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.280
artificial intelligence. You'll see things around monitoring services

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.860
Azure management tools, which is scripting languages that

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.190
you can use within Azure in order

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.720
to create different services serverless

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.150
s computing and so with this particular module

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.340
you can again choose the demos that

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.670
you feel are going to be most important even in that.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:56.320
You can choose the demos that you feel are more

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.610
Your students are more interested in. I like to pull my

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.330
students sometimes and ask them hey, which demos do you all want to focus

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.660
on which ones are you more interested and sometimes will say oh

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:10.260
want to see artificial intelligence or I want to see some of

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.670
the ways you can use serverless computing

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.840
such as functions or logic apps, so there's

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.780
lots of opportunities for demos here as well.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.800
But again, typically with these

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.950
types of areas or this particular module, these

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:28.590
are going to be tools and services, and in your exam

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.750
or in your students when they take their exam, they

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.880
maybe ask questions to help them choose which one of

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.910
these services is best for a business scenario that's given so

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.380
o I I'd like to stay pretty high level

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.720
on this module just because you won't again see really in

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.920
depth questions around how does this service

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.750
really work. It's more so.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.280
What is this service and would it meet the needs of

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.610
this business scenario, so making sure that your again

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.930
your students understand at a high level.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.890
What some of these areas are and that they feel

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:04.000
confident as they walk through these different types of demos

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.140
as well?

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.170
For module, for this is going to switch

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.730
gears a little bit and look at general security and network

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:18.910
security features.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.880
This is looking at Azure Security now

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.900
w I like to say this module can be.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.690
It can be a little overwhelming for some students

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:31.730
just because security is a very

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.570
detailed kind of topic. There it can be

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.940
pretty. It can become office technical, let's say to

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.070
some students and so with that, making sure that you

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:45.290
have examples is going to be really helpful for them.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.100
I utilized sometimes whiteboarding or

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.880
diagrams as I start to explain the different layers of

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.140
security and so there's lots of different kind of tools and

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.280
features that Azure has to help explain.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.830
You know what services can

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.920
used to ensure the safety of

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.760
data and applications and things like that.

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.910
So being able to explain to your students if you have a

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.330
resource, these are the different layers of security that you can build

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:18.240
around that particular maybe application. And this is how

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.460
it works. This is what a firewall would be used for versus a network

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.130
security group, so having some type of example to show

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:28.310
them to draw out that's going to help them to

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:29.120
better understand these types of topics.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.430
Now when we look at let's say

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.740
y, Azure Security Center, that is what we call a

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.080
re baked environment demo. That means that

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.330
if I go into the Azure portal, which I'll bring up for you all today.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.940
This is already in there for me, so the Azure security

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.030
Center, some of the monitoring services that I showed

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:54.130
which were like Azure monitor Azure service

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.950
e Health. All of those are already given to you in the Azure portal.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.150
So therefore those are easy demos, you can just go

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.280
out, pull up the security center an, show your students exactly what

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.640
it looks like, and they can navigate and kind of play

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.650
around with it. Additionally, the Azure Key vault that's

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.750
s another great demo to show that's going to be

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:19.350
a centralized cloud location where secrets certificates

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.910
s, passwords and things can be stored inside of Azure.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.330
Easy demo to show doesn't take much time

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.370
at all, and so definitely again utilizing

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.770
examples around security that your students can

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:36.110
easily understand. I bring in maybe an

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:40.380
example around your institutions

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.630
library and maybe your institution is utilizing a database

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.060
to keep track of all the books that are rented

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.310
and when they are returned, who they are rented by

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.390
That is an example around hey maybe in Azure

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.540
service could be using a database to track those things.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.730
And maybe you have a layer of security around that database so

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.230
that not just anyone can come in and start to manipulate the

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:07.010
data, modify or change it. So being able to again

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.130
as I mentioned, giving real institution examples to help your

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.700
students understand.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.710
Tips for module

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.750
5 Identity governance, privacy and compliance features.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.700
Great area here too.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.860
Really have demos as well. There's lots of opportunities

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.330
here rather than just lecturing. So first

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.600
and foremost you kind of introduce identity services you start to

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.290
o talk about what is the difference between authentication

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.340
versus authorization? I would very I would

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.780
d be surprised if there was not a question on the

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.080
exam of what is authentication versus authorization so making

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.300
g sure your students understand what the true differences

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:55.230
is going to be very important.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.370
You start to introduce cloud governance

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:03.090
strategies, understanding, really

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.250
what how they can govern subscriptions, how they

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.910
can govern, what a user can do inside of their

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.940
subscription. So role based access control

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.990
resource locks, tags, policy's making sure that

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.450
they understand what those different services are, is going to

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.840
be very helpful an for all of those types of

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.420
services. You can do a demonstration in my classes

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.030
s we have lab time.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.990
And there is a lab for each and every one of

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.450
those are back resource locks, tags and policy

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.770
y's. There's a separate lab for each one, and they're very

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.780
easy. Labs, definitely easy, and I like to say that they are fun because

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.430
I always demo them in my classes.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:47.420
Lastly, there's going to be the

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.680
option of looking at privacy and

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.920
compliance websites. So in your presentation you'll get

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.120
to apportion talking about, for example, the

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.230
Microsoft Privacy statement, the Trust Center, and

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.480
these are going to be really just slides with kind of lecture kind

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.580
of notes. I like to pull up

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:10.010
those websites and show because their public facing websites that anyone

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.230
can access. So I'll go out and search for the Microsoft

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.530
Privacy statement and I'll pull it up and I'll show my learners. Hey, this is where you can find out.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.860
What Microsoft is doing with your data, how their

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.960
processing it and for what purposes. And you can read

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.190
all about that and learn all the intricate details around that type

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.430
of information. So that's a great place to just pull up those websites and allow

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.600
your students to interact with them rather than just

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.850
talking about what those websites are.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.000
And then Lastly module 6

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.260
Azure cost management and service level agreements this

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.380
s is going to look at the factors that

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.780
influence cost, helping your students to understand tools and

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.450
ways within Azure that they can help to manage their cloud

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.590
cost. And again important that they understand these

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.920
topics in preparation for their exam here

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.160
e I always demonstrate the Azure pricing

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.460
Calculator. It's really fun.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.550
Facing website students actually

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.620
could follow along with you because all of the things that are

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.690
public facing websites of course do not cost anything because

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.950
it's not inside the portal. It's separate from that so

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:28.600
o with that pricing Calculator is a way to

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.830
see estimates around services and things

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.310
You create an Azure before you ever create them, so I

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.670
could look at how much would it cost me to create a virtual

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.810
machine with the specific configurations and I

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.830
can get estimates and see and compare cost and all

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.210
of that great stuff so.

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:49.270
Definitely great opportunities to do that with

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.460
the Azure pricing Calculator and the total cost

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.710
of ownership Calculator as well.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.990
The last couple of things here is explaining what

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.350
service level agreements are that is going to be important

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.780
because I guarantee there most likely going to see

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.860
a question on their exam around what a Nestle is

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.260
so making sure they understand that in

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:15.070
their preparation and then Lastly looking at what is preview

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.340
features versus general availability and preview

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.910
features are going to be know features that are tested

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:24.930
They're being tested by Microsoft, they're

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:25.670
going through kind of a beta mode.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.800
And once they are 100% ready to go

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.040
all the bugs and codes and things have been fixed that

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.120
t is what then becomes generally available or

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.280
general availability to all Azure customers, so making

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.320
sure that they know little kind of differences and things

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.910
around that as well is going to be helpful to them.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.430
Now let's look a little bit at

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:56.140
Demos ahnlab strategies.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.540
So the very first thing when we talk

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.890
about demos and labs, a general

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:09.080
portal demonstration should be first. So for most of

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.480
your students, if they are brand new to the cloud or really to Azure

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.840
they probably have never seen the portal or

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.460
really know how to navigate it. So that is going to be the

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.620
very first thing that you want to introduce them to.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.520
And then even also after they haven't been

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.670
introduced, being able to allow them

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.690
to do demonstrations. Maybe if you are in person they can come

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.940
and kind of walk through in front of the

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.470
class or even virtually maybe an opportunity there as

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:41.760
well. So I'm going to pull up the portal for you and we're going to

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.010
walk through a general introduction of it.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.690
Alright, so this is at first glance

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.730
what my portal looks like

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:56.380
as I pull it up. This is my home

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.030
screen. This is what I have duct as my home screen. If I wanted to

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.240
Utiliza dashboard or something different I could do

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.780
that as well but this is kind of what mine looks like at first

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:06.950
glance. When I log in.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.380
You'll notice here kind of some different icons

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.350
I have the option for sending feedback if I wanted to give

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:18.460
feedback around the portal. Things that could be improved or

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.390
changed, or things that I like. I could do that.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:24.940
I also have the option to submit a

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.390
help and support ticket so if I have any issues with the

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:31.510
portal, any issues with my service is anything that

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.980
is going on currently that I'm having a problem with

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.810
I could submit a support ticket an escalated as necessary.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.630
Portal settings here I can

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.830
change the look, the feel how I want

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.980
my portal to actually be displayed when I do

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.070
log in, and when I interact with it. So again as I mentioned

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.240
d, this is my home default view. I have the portal menu here on

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.360
the left side it could be

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.940
fly out so it's hidden, or I can have it docked

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.550
where it stays there until I want it to go away.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.000
And then you'll see the option for theme

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.670
as well. I can change kind of the theme here of what

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.040
is particularly maybe easy on my eyes or what I

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.130
would prefer. As you know what I want

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.650
ortal theme to look like.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.510
And then a couple more up here we see

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.650
e notifications notifications is going to be what's currently going

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.690
on in your subscription, so anything that takes place

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:35.530
is going to readily be a notification for

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:39.590
you to see any type of alert. Anything that has changed will be

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.460
first sent here that you can see at any given time.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.740
And then we have the cloud shell.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.000
So as I mentioned in one of the modules there

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.160
e is the what we call Azure management

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.680
tools and you have the option to utilize scripting

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.850
languages to create things in Azure

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.100
and that is what this cloud shell is used for, so this

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.380
icon here at the top allows me to open it up and I can use

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.870
either PowerShell or Bash to meet my needs.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:14.240
So that is how you access that terminal

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.420
based browser window there.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.670
Now some kind of key things

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.720
navigating here on the portal you saw these icons here at the top

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.860
but you also see a lot of other things going

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.960
on, so will first focus on the left side here

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.070
This is the portal menu

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.210
This is going to be ways that I can just get to things quickly so for

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.400
r example if I want to create a resource, you'll see I can select

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.800
their search for the resource I'm wanting to create

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.010
Again Home Dashboard view options, and then I

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.430
can also look at all services to see what's out there.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.150
As well.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:52.350
You'll also notice favourites here. These are

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:55.360
going to be my default favourites, so when I created this

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.400
subscription these favourites, we're already

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.440
listed here for me. If I want to take

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.580
away some of these, I can highlight an unselect this star or

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:07.950
for the same I can select the star and add it to

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:08.910
this list and I'll see it here.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.070
You also see you have recent resources

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.530
These are some things that may be listed here that I've used

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.950
recently, and then also here at the top as

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.200
well. I have the option to create a resource here as well.

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:27.150
But one of the really cool things I want to note is

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.290
that at the top here I can search

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.640
for resources.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.520
And let's say for example, I want to look up

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.130
virtual machines. It brings up the services and then it also

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:42.190
brings up other things as well. So for example, the marketplace

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:45.210
where I can search for multiple types of

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:48.300
different resources, whether they're Microsoft related

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.950
or other product vendors and things as well.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:54.960
And then also documentation

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.970
I can readily see different

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:01.310
documentation around this service or anything that I'm wanting to

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:04.090
search and I can read up about it as I'm thinking about creating it.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.780
So while we're here, this is again just a

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.980
general introduction to navigate and I want

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.080
t to walk through. If I were to kind

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.220
of at a high level, create something in Azure and how

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.440
I demonstrate for my students, so I'm going to select virtual

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.930
machines on the left side here.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.330
It's out of my favourites list. You'll see I have

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.590
a couple of list you of them listed here, but in

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:38.360
my class, if I was going to demonstrate creating one, I'm

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:38.560
going to select add.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.660
Then I select virtual machine.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.740
And now you'll see here. It brings up all of

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.760
the different tabs and steps that I must take to create

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.790
the virtual machine as I walk

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:55.800
through these types of demonstrations for

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.550
your students is OK to keep it pretty high level

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.580
because, again, remember they're not going to actually have

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.660
to do this in their exam. So however you want to go in

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.060
depth with the creation of these resources is

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.100
completely up to you. However, if your students are doing labs

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.240
they are going to walk through these steps.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.350
So of course, explaining that they you

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.390
l have a subscription and their case, it'll be

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:21.210
their student subscription.

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:25.040
Explaining that anything with the red astrik

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.080
is required. So for example, knowing and

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.880
explaining what a resource group is to them and in

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.130
your.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.220
Slides there when you're teaching module

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:39.410
2, you are explaining what a resource group is, which

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:42.790
is where your resources live. So anything that I create an Azure

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.950
must be inside of a resource group. There is no way around

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:49.130
it, so I either create a resource group

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:50.850
or select from one of the ones listed here.

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:55.190
And the purpose really of the Resource Group is for organization.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.060
And then you'll see also things such as selecting the

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.330
virtual machine name, selecting the region

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:07.030
remember, region, meaning that this is where the data

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.200
center is inside of. So if I select WUS that is

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.700
s where the data center is going to be in West US.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.820
And then so on and so forth around what you

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.220
ether they are selecting availability zones

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:23.690
images, things of that sort. So I do explain each detail

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.890
as I walk through and then also you can explain kind

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:30.050
of as you go down the different apps of creating the

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.230
virtual machine. So again, definitely

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:36.350
great opportunity for your students to get that hands on

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:39.350
practice, but they will not have to actually do this in their exam.

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:45.670
Now I did mentioned what I called as

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.690
pre baked environment demos, that's things

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.740
that are already here that I can just show and I don't actually have

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.220
to create things and the security center was one

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.010
of them. So if I open up the security center

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.210
You'll see here. There's a lot of different things going on

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:05.230
here, and if I go to recommendations

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:08.370
it shows me first hand some of the

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:11.500
e recommendations I could use to implement to create

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.680
e to make my environment more secure, more highly

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:19.080
know, secure. As far as making sure my data, my applications

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.620
all of that has the upmost level of

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:22.820
security necessary.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.830
Now what I do want to note with this type

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.910
of demonstration if you don't have any resources

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.980
let's say in your subscription like say you just created

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.280
it and you went to security center, you're not

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.800
going to see anything here, and so when you get to this

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.100
portion of creating or wanting to demo the security

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.300
center, you may want to create a couple of resources

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.700
just so that you're able to see some type

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.800
of percentage or feedback or

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.590
recommendation in order to help your students understand what this looks like.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.610
When it comes to the security center

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.360
or any of the other monitoring tools.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.270
If I go to Azure monitor again another

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.690
r kind of pre baked environment

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:11.770
here that I can just kind of look through

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.820
and read and learn more about the resources that

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.100
I have. So again I have things

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.140
already here. I can select alerts, I can do different things, but if

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.390
I don't have any resources listed I will not see anything

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.790
to really demo for my students, so it's

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:30.860
OK to create a couple of different things

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:35.270
prior to your class, but making sure that you shut down those resources and you don't just have them.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.320
Constantly up and running because that is going

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.470
to eat at your credits. So if you for

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.870
example created.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.120
A virtual machine a couple days

00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:49.300
before and once you teach your class when you demonstrate

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.530
e the VM and all of that great stuff maybe

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:55.950
e at the end of the class you shut down that VM, or at the end of the class

00:55:55.950 --> 00:56:00.530
you delete that VM so that you're not continuing to incur

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.940
any cost related to it, and you can save your credits as you continue to teach your class.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.890
So that's kind of just a general

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.010
introduction of the portal. How you can kind of navigate

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:17.270
around it again, just showing you some of the pre

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:20.720
ed things in there that you can leverage and use, and then at a

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.930
high level kind of looking at if you were to kind of

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.030
give a demonstration such as

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.630
a VM explaining the different topics, explaining why they are important when your

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.760
students are creating is going to help them better understand.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.850
So I kind of already showed you that general

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.980
portal demo we walked through some of the kind of

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.390
environments that are already there for you to leverage and use

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:51.460
Now a couple of other tidbits of

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.750
best practices and things that you can benefit

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:55.460
from recording demos.

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:59.800
As we know we are in a unique time and

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.220
things are a lot different than they were, you're

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.370
even couple years ago. An recording demos

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.800
can be very helpful for you simply because.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.730
If you're wanting to maintain certain

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.900
timing in your class, or even in the event

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.350
that there are technical difficulties, anything that may happen

00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:23.580
it could be helpful for you to have demos

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.750
or recorded demos as a backup, or you can integrate them into

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:30.100
your classroom as you teach as well

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.690
you could have it recorded and then explain as it's playing

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:36.820
There's lots of different options there, but definitely I would

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.000
record demos if possible for purposes of

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.010
backup. If anything were to happen as well.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.780
Last couple of things here

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:50.290
Using regions closest to your location. That's going to be

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.860
very helpful just because you want to make sure that there is

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.500
no customer latency when it comes to creating resources, it'll

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.540
probably be very tempting for your students to

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:03.610
want to create things in Japan or

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:06.710
different things across Azure, however

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:09.970
they could run into potential

00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:13.570
latency or other things as they start to try to create things

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:13.610
across the globe.

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.090
And then Lastly familiarizing

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:21.270
yourself with the labs and being able to troubleshoot

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:25.450
So what that means is, as your students are going to begin to

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.460
walk through the labs and

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:31.730
practicing with hands on opportunities you want to

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:34.770
o make sure that you understand how these

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.910
resources are created and being able to help them

00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:41.530
in troubleshoot in the event that they do have any

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.910
hiccups or issues or there stuck at certain

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.100
points. So making sure that when you approach teaching.

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.350
In integrating these labs that they are not just

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:53.300
as brand new to you as they are to the students so that you have some familiarity

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.410
with the lab and that you're able to help them.

00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:06.290
Alright, so now let's look at supplemental

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:06.770
materials.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:11.140
So we walked through the module best

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.610
practices. Some of the lab strategies and you

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:17.730
onstrations, and understanding how to approach

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:22.060
that. Now these are going to be important materials for yourself

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.700
and for your students also.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.810
Now if you look at that first kind

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.170
of link there AKA dot Ms Slash.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:34.040
AZ-900

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.180
h 900 update that is going to be a

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.440
current breakdown and I'll pull that up for you to view as well

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:43.650
But that's going to be a current breakdown of

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:48.120
all of the topics that are covered for the AZ 900. When I look at that I look at

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.150
t it like a syllabus. It's really easy to understand

00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:54.240
and follow to see. OK, Module 1 covers these

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.200
topics and this is maybe how I want to break it down for my class.

00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:01.160
So I'm going to pull that up for you so that you can get

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.270
a look at it yourself.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.750
So if I go out to a

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:10.790
search engine and I look up EZ 9

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:15.300
00 Microsoft Azure fundamentals, it'll take me to this certification

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.430
exam page. You'll see here it'll say the

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.600
e content was updated November 9th and it says please

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.000
download the skills measured document to see what has

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.360
changed. So if I Scroll down here.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.900
You'll see I have the option to schedule the exam, I know

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.260
that as instructors and students you have a

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.360
different process than we do here with the industry so

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.760
o you I believe utilized sort of port and have a different

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.450
kind of structure there.

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:46.370
But as I continue to Scroll down here, you'll see

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:50.250
skills measured and it breaks down again. The six modules that are

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.400
covered and the percentages as we saw earlier, and you'll

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.630
see this hyper link for download exam skills outline.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.790
I'm gonna open it up in a new tab.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.050
And you'll see here that it gives me

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:07.110
a kind of breakdown

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:10.610
and documentation around each area that's being covered for the

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.950
exam. So as I start to scroll.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.880
It's telling me OK describe concepts and

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.170
it gives me bullet points of all the different areas of what's

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:19.840
being covered in there.

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:24.370
Also, for module two it's breaking down

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:25.940
each topic that's being covered.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.680
So I again, as I mentioned, I view this as a

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.990
syllabus. It's really easy to look at it and

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.410
understand. Oh hey, this is what I need to cover and it really may

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.810
help as you determine how you want to

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:43.330
teach an fit this content into your institution

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:46.490
Weather again you do it as a standalone course

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.770
Or if you decide to integrate it with another course as

01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:49.800
well.

01:01:52.390 --> 01:01:55.590
So again, if you want to access

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:58.770
this, I'll pull up the hyperlink or the short link again, but

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:02.420
again, if you go out and search for the AZ 900

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.350
exam and it gave brings you this page if you scroll

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:09.300
l down you will see skills measured and you can download that as well.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.430
So again, the short link for it is listed there on the slide.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.770
Now for a couple of the other things listed here there

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.110
e is Microsoft learn which I already mentioned in the

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:26.140
beginning as the place that you will want to go in your

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.060
students for self paced learning that is

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.310
s what we within Microsoft recommend to all of our learners in

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:36.780
our classes that they go through that learning path

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.190
to make sure that they are able to digest the content at

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:43.210
their own pace and that they feel comfortable

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:45.370
and confident as they prepare to take the exam.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.890
And then again the learning download

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.560
d Center as I had mentioned earlier, that's going to be where you

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.810
can access a lot of the

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:00.020
information that, whether that is your assessment

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.340
guides, whether that is your.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.790
Recording that you want to see from

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:10.340
today's presentation. If you need any type of

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.390
handbooks, anything that you are possibly needing

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.550
to prepare for this course can be found

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:17.630
in the Learning Download Center.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:22.760
And then Lastly Microsoft docs

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:26.020
I like to utilize Microsoft learn

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.330
n an Microsoft docs hand in hand. Microsoft Docs is

01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:32.950
going to be essentially articles around the different

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:36.320
topics and services within Azure, so if you or your

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.590
students wanted to learn more about

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:43.610
let's say what an availability zone is and you want a detailed

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.100
information that is exactly where you want to go as

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.130
Microsoft Docs, because it not only will give

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.960
you breakdown and paragraphs of information about the service.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.220
It will also give you how to guides, how to integrate it

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.350
with other services. It's really in

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.470
depth documentation that you can leverage and benefit from.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.660
Alright, so for exam preparation?

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.370
Now that we've walked through kind of a summary of

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:21.650
the learning, an understanding the six different

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.710
modules, the audience that you're teaching setting

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:28.470
g the expectations for your students, all of that

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.100
great stuff. Again, all of these things tide

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.440
directly to the certification exam, and this is proving

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.220
the knowledge around the different Azure services the foundational

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.670
l knowledge of the cloud, so making sure your students

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:44.730
feel confident that they are not.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.880
Overwhelmed or filling that this is a lot

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.090
that they cannot retain? Making sure that they do

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.010
feel comfortable with the content that you're teaching.

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:57.070
Now we also covered again those

01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:01.210
learning resources, so looking at again the learning download

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:05.300
Center, the skills measured outline

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.500
the Microsoft Learning path. All of those things are

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.670
not only going to be beneficial to you as an instructor, but also to your students

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:15.280
as well. So I encourage you to share those resources with

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.780
them because every student as we know has

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.410
different learning styles, so we want to make sure that if

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:25.500
possible, we can meet all of the different learning styles for students as well.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.630
And then for the exam discussion that is

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.920
going to focus on again making sure that

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.400
your students feel confident letting them kind of what

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.000
to expect when it comes to the exam as I

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.030
I mentioned earlier, 700 points out of 1000 points to pass.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.160
All multiple choice

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.360
questions and multiple choice can also vary it

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.560
t could be drag and drop, true and

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.650
false. Select two out of five that are correct

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.900
things of that sort, so definitely variations of

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.920
multiple choice, but again nothing where they

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.130
will have to actually do any labs, any demonstrations there is

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:10.630
no hands on in the exam

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.590
itself, so making sure that your students understand that also.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.810
And then Lastly, just

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:20.410
really honing in on this is a great opportunity for

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:23.740
them to expand their skill set not only within the

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.950
cloud but also building their self

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.020
confidence as they start to prepare to maybe

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:33.960
graduate from the institution and start in their

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.020
own work journey. This is a great skill to have, especially for those that are

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.750
in technology. The cloud is forever growing

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.700
changing. It's an innovative place to be and it's awesome.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.750
So I truly, truly hope that you encourage your

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.800
students to take the exam and to fill that

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.820
It is a great accomplishment to add to their current skill

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.320
set that they already have.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.220
So with that being said, I wanna say thank you for

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:10.340
joining this session today. This has been wonderful for

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.540
myself to be able to share not only my Azure a little

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.610
e bit of my Azure knowledge with you, but also how I

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:19.740
approach teaching this course. It's really important as you

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.920
start to teach it that you feel comfortable and

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.160
prepared and that you have all of the resources that you need

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.580
when it comes to taking the opportunity to then

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.970
teach this to your student. So I hope that you all have

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:35.810
thoroughly enjoyed this. If you do have any questions.

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:38.850
We will be here in order for you to post those

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:42.030
in the chat and I will be more than happy to answer

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:45.040
those questions for you. But again, thank you

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.880
for your time today over to Marissa.

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:52.360
Thank you so much. My love and thank you all for

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.560
attending. We would love your thoughts on the session

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.760
Please fill out our survey. I put the link in

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.460
the Q&amp;A panel as well and as Mala

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.540
mentioned, we will be hanging out here just to see

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.610
if anybody has any questions that they want to put in

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:12.000
the Q&amp;A panel in the next couple of minutes

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.440
and thank you again and hope to see you in the next training.
